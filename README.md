## Project Description

ShareShelf is a web application designed to facilitate the sharing and claiming of items within a community.

- Netlify: For deployment

## Challenges and Future Features

## Problem Solving

ShareShelf addresses the issue of waste and underutilization of resources by providing a platform where items can be reused and recycled within a community, thereby promoting sustainability.

## Stretch Goals

In addition to the current features, future enhancements for ShareShelf are planned to enhance user experience and functionality:

- Implementing a Chat Feature: Allowing users to communicate directly within the app for coordinating item pickups and inquiries.
- Adding a Category Filter: Facilitating easier and more efficient item searches by categorizing items.
- Implementing User Reviews and Ratings: Enabling users to rate and review each other to build trust within the community.
- A Working "Shopping Cart": Implementing a feature where users can keep track of items they have claimed. This 'shopping cart' will allow users to manage their claimed items, view the status of each claim, and coordinate with the item owners for collection.
